**Welcome and Overview**

Today we discussed in detail your full-arch implant treatment, including:

1. Exactly which teeth and implant fixtures are planned

2. Reasonable alternatives (from doing nothing to various denture/bridge options)

3. All material risks and their approximate likelihoods

4. The sedation/anesthesia plan and associated safety measures

5. Financial obligations, insurance notice, and your No Surprises Act rights

6. How we’ll use any photos/videos or communicate by email/SMS

7. Post-op pain management, including opioid risks and alternatives

You’ve had the opportunity to ask questions, to see the statistical ranges for each complication, and to confirm that you understand each element. If anything remains unclear at any point, please let us know right away—your signature on the following pages certifies that you have been fully informed and that we have addressed your questions thoroughly.

# **Material Risks (estimated incidence shown)**

| Event | Likelihood | Comments |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Early implant loss (\< 1 yr) | 2–5 % | may require removal & re‑placement |
| Permanent lower‑lip/chin numbness | ≤ 2 % | inferior alveolar nerve proximity |
| Sinus perforation → chronic sinusitis | 1–3 % (upper arch) | may need ENT repair |
| Jaw fracture | \< 0.5 % | severely atrophic bone |
| Infection requiring IV antibiotics | 1–4 % | higher in smokers/uncontrolled DM |
| IV‑sedation airway compromise | 0.1–0.3 % | emergency airway equipment on site |
| Hospital admission / death | \< 0.05 % | reported in national databases |

I have had the opportunity to ask about each risk and understand that percentages are population estimates, not guarantees of my individual outcome.
