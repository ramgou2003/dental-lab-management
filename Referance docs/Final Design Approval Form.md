Design Approval & Fee Agreement

1\. Design Review. I confirm I have had adequate time to feel, inspect, and try in the proposed final appliance design supplied by New York Dental Implants. I understand the shape, contours, occlusion, shade, and materials as presented today.

2\. Final Fabrication. By signing below, I hereby approve the design as‑is and authorize fabrication of my final prosthesis. No further design changes will be made prior to fabrication.

3\. Post‑Approval Changes. I acknowledge that any modification, adjustment, remake, or replacement requested after this approval (including but not limited to changes in shade, shape, fit, or occlusion) will incur a fixed surcharge of $6,354. This fee is in addition to any standard laboratory, clinical, or warranty costs, and is not covered under New York Dental Implants’ three‑year warranty.

4\. Warranty Reminder. I understand the three‑year warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship but does not cover patient‑driven design changes.
