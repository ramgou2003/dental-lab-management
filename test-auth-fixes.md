# Authentication Fixes Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Token Refresh User Data Loss**: Modified `AuthContext.tsx` to refetch user data when tokens are refreshed
2. **Session State Management**: Enhanced `sessionManager.ts` to better handle authentication state changes
3. **Authentication Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track when user data is lost
4. **Cache Validation**: Improved `authCache.ts` with better data validation and logging
5. **Fallback Mechanism**: Added automatic user data restoration when profile becomes null

## Testing Steps

### 1. Initial Login Test
1. Open the application at http://localhost:8081
2. Login with your super admin credentials
3. Check browser console for authentication logs
4. Verify your name appears in the left bottom corner (not "User")

### 2. Token Refresh Test
1. After logging in, wait for about 5-10 minutes
2. Perform some actions (navigate between pages)
3. Check browser console for "Token refreshed successfully" messages
4. Verify your name still appears correctly after token refresh
5. Verify you still have access to User Management page

### 3. Session Persistence Test
1. Login and navigate to different pages
2. Refresh the browser page (F5)
3. Check that your name loads correctly after refresh
4. Verify role-based access is maintained

### 4. Debug Information
Open browser console (F12) and look for these log messages:
- "Fetching user data for: [user-id]"
- "User profile fetched successfully"
- "Token refreshed successfully"
- "Refreshing user data after token refresh"
- "Sidebar: User profile changed"

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Before Fix**: 
- User name would show as "User" after some time
- Role access might be lost
- Pages would go blank

✅ **After Fix**:
- User name should always show correctly
- Role-based access should be maintained
- No blank pages
- Automatic recovery if user data is temporarily lost

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: 
   - Open browser console
   - Type: `clearAuthCache()`
   - Refresh the page

2. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Look for any error messages
   - Check if user data fetching is failing

3. **Verify Database Connection**:
   - Ensure Supabase connection is working
   - Check RLS policies are not blocking access

## Key Changes Made

### AuthContext.tsx
- Added user data refetch on TOKEN_REFRESHED event
- Added automatic user data restoration mechanism
- Enhanced debugging logs

### sessionManager.ts
- Improved token refresh handling
- Better session state tracking
- Enhanced error handling

### authCache.ts
- Added data validation
- Improved cache expiry handling
- Better logging for debugging

### Sidebar.tsx
- Added user profile change tracking
- Enhanced debugging for UI updates

## Next Steps

After testing, if the issue persists:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify the user profile exists in the database
3. Check if RLS policies are blocking access
4. Test with different user roles to isolate the issue
